# Tests

## Structure
- `unit/` - isolated logic and UI-contract tests.
- `regression/` - scenario and behavior invariants that should stay stable over time.
- Root-level files - broader integration and invariant coverage.

## Running
```bash
pytest tests/
pytest tests/unit/
pytest tests/unit/test_metrics.py
```

## Notes
- `pyproject.toml` at the repo root configures `pythonpath = ["."]` for pytest, so no manual `PYTHONPATH` export is needed.
- Shared artifact writers and job builders live in `tests/conftest.py`.
