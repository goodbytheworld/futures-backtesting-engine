src/backtest_engine/portfolio_layer/adapters/legacy_strategy_adapter.py

Adapts the single-asset BaseStrategy API to the portfolio engine.

Background
----------
All existing strategies inherit from BaseStrategy (src/strategies/base.py) and
expect a BacktestEngine-shaped object as their first constructor argument. The
portfolio engine is structurally different (shared capital, multi-symbol), so
this module provides a minimal adapter surface that satisfies the strategy
constructor contract without introducing a circular dependency on BacktestEngine.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
1. self.engine.portfolio.positions[symbol] is a SINGLE-ASSET dict, not the
   shared PortfolioBook.  Strategies that call get_position() or is_flat()
   see the MockPortfolio — their own per-instance dict — not the real portfolio
   ledger.  This means internal SL/TP tracking inside the strategy is correct,
   but the strategy CANNOT see positions opened by other slots.

2. self.market_order(side, quantity) — the quantity field in the returned
   Order is ignored by the portfolio engine.  Only the DIRECTION (BUY/SELL)
   matters; actual sizing is deferred entirely to the Allocator.

3. Risk limits inside BaseStrategy (daily loss caps, drawdown halts) that
   depend on self.engine.portfolio are NOT connected to the real portfolio book.

These limitations are acceptable for the current single-lens strategy design.
If a strategy needs portfolio-aware sizing, it should be refactored to accept a
PortfolioContext injection directly.

    Constructs a single-asset strategy instance for use in the portfolio engine.

    Methodology:
        1. Creates a _MockEngine with the strategy's specific symbol data.
        2. Wraps BacktestSettings with _PatchedSettings to inject slot params.
        3. Instantiates the strategy class and calls on_start() if available.

    Args:
        strategy_class: The BaseStrategy subclass to instantiate.
        data: Full OHLCV DataFrame for this (slot, symbol) pair.
        symbol: Ticker symbol this instance will trade.
        settings: BacktestSettings instance (used as the base for patching).
        params: Slot-level param overrides (from StrategySlot.params).

    Returns:
        An instantiated, ready-to-call strategy instance.
