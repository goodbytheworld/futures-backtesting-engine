src/backtest_engine/execution/spread_model.py

Deterministic spread model for backtest execution cost simulation:

    static               — constant spread_ticks per fill, independent of market state.
    adaptive_volatility  — spread widens when realized volatility rises above a rolling
                           baseline and narrows back when it falls, using a linear step
                           function derived from recent close-to-close log returns.

Design contract:
    - No state is held between calls.  The function is pure given its inputs.
    - All parameters come from BacktestSettings to satisfy the no-magic-numbers rule.
    - Inputs are sliced to bar[t] or earlier so the model never uses future data.
    - When history is insufficient, both modes fall back to spread_ticks without raising.

    Returns the deterministic number of spread ticks to apply at fill time.

    Methodology:
        static mode:
            Returns base_ticks unchanged.  Used when transaction costs should
            be fixed and independent of regime.

        adaptive_volatility mode:
            1. Estimates current realized volatility from the most recent
               vol_lookback close-to-close log returns.
            2. Estimates a rolling baseline volatility using the most recent
               vol_baseline_lookback returns from the same series.
            3. Computes the signed step count: how many vol_step_pct-wide bands
               the current vol lies above (positive) or below (negative) the
               baseline.
            4. Returns base_ticks * step_multiplier^steps, rounded to the
               nearest integer and floored at 0.

        Both modes fall back to base_ticks when the close series is too short
        to produce reliable vol estimates.

    Args:
        mode: Spread mode — 'static' or 'adaptive_volatility'.
        base_ticks: Fixed or base tick count from settings.spread_ticks.
        closes: Close price series up to and including the current bar.
                Required for adaptive_volatility mode; ignored for static.
        vol_step_pct: Fractional volatility band width per step, e.g. 0.10 = 10 %.
                      Each full band above baseline widens spread by one step;
                      each full band below narrows it by one step.
        step_multiplier: Multiplier applied per step, e.g. 1.5 means one step
                         above baseline triples the base spread (1.5^1 = 1.5x),
                         two steps gives 1.5^2 = 2.25x, etc.  Values below 1.0
                         narrow the spread on each step.
        vol_lookback: Bars used to estimate current realized volatility.
                      Corresponds to a short estimation window (e.g. 20 bars).
        vol_baseline_lookback: Bars used to estimate the rolling baseline vol.
                               Corresponds to a longer reference window (e.g. 100 bars).

    Returns:
        Adjusted integer tick count (>= 0).  A value of 0 means zero spread.
