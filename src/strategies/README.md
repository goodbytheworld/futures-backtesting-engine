# Strategy Development Guide

This package contains concrete trading strategies and the registry that exposes them to the rest of the system.

Each production strategy should be self-contained in its own file under
`src/strategies/`. Shared code belongs in `src/strategies/filters/` only when
it is a pure indicator, mask builder, or other stateless helper. Avoid
cross-strategy execution helpers or "family" loaders that hide runtime logic.

## Current Strategies

Registered strategy IDs currently include:

- `ict_ob`
- `sma_pullback`
- `three_bar_mr`
- `rfp_fractal`
- `channel_breakout`
- `bollinger_squeeze_breakout`
- `keltner_tightening_breakout`
- `diamond_breakout`
- `wyckoff_breakout_aggressive`
- `wyckoff_breakout_moderate`
- `wyckoff_breakout_conservative`

`registry.py` is the canonical source of truth. The README is a contributor aid only.

## Contract

All strategies:

- inherit from `BaseStrategy`
- receive an engine instance in `__init__`
- precompute expensive indicators up front
- keep `on_bar()` lightweight

## Execution Timing

Do not manually shift signals to "fix" timing.

The engine contract is already:

- strategy evaluates `bar[t]`
- returned orders execute at `open[t+1]`

Adding extra `shift(1)` logic usually creates a delayed strategy, not a safer one.

Non-market orders still follow the same no-lookahead rule:

- a `LIMIT` / `STOP` / `STOP_LIMIT` created on `bar[t]` first becomes eligible on `bar[t+1]`
- `DAY` expires on the next calendar day
- `IOC` is attempted on the first eligible bar and then cancelled if unfilled

## Native Order Support

Single-asset strategies can return:

- `MARKET`
- `LIMIT`
- `STOP`
- `STOP_LIMIT`

Use the convenience factories in `BaseStrategy` rather than instantiating `Order` directly when possible.

Important single-engine bracket rule:

- multiple same-bar `reduce_only=True` non-market orders are auto-grouped as one protective OCO bracket
- if both stop and target are reachable on the same coarse bar, the single engine first tries lower-timeframe replay when `intrabar_conflict_resolution=lower_timeframe`
- if replay data is missing, incomplete, or anomalous, the single engine falls back to the pessimistic policy and lets the stop win
- this rule exists because the legacy strategy contract returns only `List[Order]`, not an explicit bracket object

Practical implication:

- native stop/target brackets are now safe in the single engine only when emitted as same-bar `reduce_only` non-market siblings
- if you emit unrelated resting orders on the same bar, do not mark them all `reduce_only=True` unless you actually want OCO behavior

## Portfolio Bridge Notes

The portfolio engine is still target-driven, but it now preserves enough raw intent for resting entries to work.

Current bridge behavior:

- the live portfolio position is the source of truth for bridge state, but raw non-`reduce_only` order intent is still preserved
- if a strategy is flat and emits a non-`reduce_only` `LIMIT` / `STOP` / `STOP_LIMIT` entry, the bridge infers provisional direction from that raw order side
- if a strategy is already invested and emits an opposite-side non-`reduce_only` order, the bridge maps it to explicit `CLOSE` or `REVERSE` intent instead of blindly reusing the live position sign
- `reduce_only=True` orders are excluded from entry-direction fallback so protective exits do not request fresh exposure
- same-bar entry plus protective bracket metadata is preserved and forwarded into the portfolio OMS as parent/child intent

Practical implication:

- flat pending-entry strategies such as `three_bar_mr` and `channel_breakout` can trade in portfolio mode without pre-setting `_invested=True`
- explicit exit/reversal strategies can now close or reverse live portfolio positions without local bridge workarounds

## Adding A Strategy

1. Create a new module in `src/strategies/`.
2. Keep the strategy's config and execution state in that same file.
3. Use `src/strategies/filters/` only for stateless helpers.
4. Precompute indicators in `__init__`.
5. Implement `on_bar()` using O(1) lookups.
6. Implement `get_search_space()` in the same module if WFO support is needed.
7. Register the strategy in `registry.py`.

## Optimization Guidance

`get_search_space()` is for walk-forward optimization and should reflect robust ranges, not ultra-fine parameter mining.

Guidelines:

- prefer coarse steps over tiny increments
- optimize the 4-6 parameters that most affect regime, entry quality, and risk placement
- avoid stuffing the search space with every boolean or cosmetic knob
- keep the number of optimized parameters within the global WFO budget in `BacktestSettings.wfo_max_parameters`
- if a strategy uses `trade_direction`, it can be a categorical search dimension when directionality is materially part of the thesis

Good candidates:

- lookback lengths
- ATR windows / ATR multiples
- regime filters
- entry offsets for `LIMIT` / `STOP` logic

Usually weak candidates:

- logging toggles
- redundant mirrored thresholds
- overly precise decimal steps that will not generalize OOS

## Registry

`registry.py` is the source of truth for:

- CLI strategy IDs
- accepted aliases
- class loading for portfolio YAML configs

If the strategy is not registered, it is not part of the platform.

## Design Guidance

- keep data slicing out of `on_bar()`
- keep comments and docstrings in English
- put reusable execution settings in `src/backtest_engine/settings.py`
- add tests for unusual entry, exit, or stateful behavior
- if a strategy emits native protective exits, add at least one regression test covering bracket cancel behavior
